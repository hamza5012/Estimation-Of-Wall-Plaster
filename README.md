Title: Simplifying Wall Plaster Estimations: A Practical Code

Are you into construction or DIY home improvement projects? I've developed a handy Python code for estimating wall plaster requirements efficiently. It simplifies the process and ensures accuracy in your material calculations.

Key Points:
1. **Functionality**: The code estimates the quantity of cement and sand required for wall plastering based on user-defined ratios, wall dimensions, plaster thickness, and material density.
2. **User-Friendly**: With straightforward input prompts, users can easily input their specific requirements, such as cement and sand ratios, wall dimensions, plaster thickness, and material densities.
3. **Accurate Results**: The code computes both wet and dry volumes of mortar, providing precise quantities of cement and sand needed for the project.
4. **Developer Credits**: Developed by Muhammad Hamza Javed, the code is a testament to the power of programming in streamlining construction processes.
